/**
 * Port of searchProperty() from Code.gs (Code.gs:1027). Tax is
 * recalculated fresh on every search — never trusted from a stored
 * column — exactly as in the source system.
 *
 * Whether the CURRENT year's billing cycle has already been paid: a
 * demand notice bundles current-year tax + solid waste + the flat
 * "other charges" into one total, and paying it advances
 * tax_paid_till_year to that notice's assessment_year (see
 * payment.service.ts). If tax_paid_till_year has reached (or passed)
 * the property's own assessment_year, that whole cycle is settled —
 * this is checked explicitly below (`currentCyclePaid`), rather than
 * always showing the calculated amount as freshly due regardless of
 * payment history, which was the gap being fixed here. Arrears already
 * self-correct once tax_paid_till_year advances (summarizeArrears's
 * pending window naturally shrinks to nothing) — only the CURRENT
 * cycle's own due-vs-paid status needed this explicit check.
 *
 * ⚠ SCOPE NOTE: this assumes nothing billable was added to the property
 * (a new penal charge, a solid-waste-type change, etc.) after the notice
 * that was actually paid — there's no per-notice snapshot of exactly
 * what was billed to compare against. If a charge is added mid-cycle
 * after payment, this will still show that cycle as fully paid. This
 * mirrors the same simplification already made elsewhere (arrears
 * trusted from stored stage rows rather than re-verified line by line).
