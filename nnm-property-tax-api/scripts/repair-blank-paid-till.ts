/**
 * Holdings whose "tax paid till" year is blank (mostly migrated from older data).
 *
 * A blank paid-till year means "nothing paid since the holding was created", so billing runs from the holding
 * creation year. For each such holding this script works out the right years and, with --apply, corrects them:
 *
 *   1. Paid-till year that a later save wiped: a Tax Collector's discrepancy / survey report has no paid-till field,
 *      and approving one used to blank it. The last value in the holding's history is put back (unless someone
 *      deliberately cleared it).
 *   2. Otherwise the old record's "Last Payment Year" (old-holding upload sheet), when it has one.
 *   3. Never lower than the last year a valid receipt shows as paid.
 *   4. Holding creation year: when the old record has an EARLIER creation year than the one stored (the import put
 *      the import year in when the column was missing or misread), the old record's year is used and the holding's
 *      tax assessment periods are recomputed from its floors.
 *
 * Anything else is left blank (= billed from the creation year) and listed in the report, with a note where the
 * creation year looks like an import placeholder, or where years have no assessment on file (those holdings are
 * already held: no notice or payment until the assessment is completed).
 *
 * Open (unpaid) demand notices of every corrected holding are superseded - they demand the wrong years; the next
 * notice is generated with the corrected years. Every change is logged in holding_year_repair_log.
 *
 * Usage (from the nnm-property-tax-api folder):
 *   npm run repair-paid-till                 # report only - nothing is changed
 *   npm run repair-paid-till -- --apply      # make the changes
 * The report is written to repair-paid-till-report.csv in the current folder.
